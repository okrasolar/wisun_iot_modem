 * Size of NCP Spinel command response queue.
 *
 * NCP guarantees that it can respond up to `CONFIG_NCP_SPINEL_RESPONSE_QUEUE_SIZE` spinel commands at the
 * same time. The spinel protocol defines a Transaction ID (TID) as part of spinel command frame (the TID can be
 * a value 0-15 where TID 0 is used for frames which require no response). Spinel protocol can support at most support
 * 15 simultaneous commands.
 *
 * The host driver implementation may further limit the number of simultaneous Spinel command frames (e.g., wpantund
 * limits this to two). This configuration option can be used to reduce the response queue size.
